Turtle Art Project: Cartoon Character Drawing

This Python project uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a detailed cartoon character (likely a humanoid figure with expressive eyes and colorful clothing). The drawing combines circles, lines, and filled shapes to create a vibrant illustration.

Features

Dynamic speed control: Adjusts drawing speed with speed() for smoother animation.

Colorful design: Uses multiple colors like red, blue, green, and white for different parts of the character.

Detailed anatomy: Includes head, body, arms, and expressive eyes.

Complex curves and lines: Implements arcs, circles, and loops to create realistic shapes.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Turtle graphics library (usually comes with Python standard library)

How to Run

Install Python (if not already installed).

Save the script as turtle_character.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

python spiderman.py


Watch the character being drawn step by step in a pop-up window.

Code Overview

Head and Face: Uses circle() and fd() with angles to shape the head.

Body and Arms: Combines lines and arcs to create limbs with colored fills.

Eyes: Large, expressive eyes are drawn using filled arcs for a cartoon effect.

Details: Vertical lines, curves, and smaller circles add texture and dimension.

Notes

The drawing speed can be adjusted by modifying speed() values.

You can change colors using fillcolor() to customize the character's appearance.

Some functions (like oo()) are recursive or repetitive for detailing body parts.
